# Post Office
Two kinds of things can be posted: letters and boxes.

## Letters:
* they have address,
* date when it was posted,
* fixed price of 1.99 euros
## Boxes:
* they have two types (small and big box),
* address, date when it was posted
* weight of the box measured in grams and their price is calculated differently.
    * small boxes are 7.99 euros,
    * big boxes are 10.29 euros + 0.29 * every grams of their weight
## The post office can:

* list all of the things posted on a given date
* calculate the total income from the posted things of a given type (letter, small
  box, big box)
